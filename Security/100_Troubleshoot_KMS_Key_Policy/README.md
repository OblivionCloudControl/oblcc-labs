# Level 100: Troubleshoot KMS Key policies

## Introduction

In this hands-on learning activity, you will work with the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to define a policy which restricts access to encrypted objects in S3 buckets. When working with S3, we already know we can apply a bucket policy which can restrict object access to specific users or groups. However, when working with encrypted objects in S3, we can use the encryption key's policy to restrict access as well.

## Goals

* Define a policy which restricts access to encrypted objects in S3 buckets

## Prerequisites

* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes.

NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
